## NYC 2010 Census Data Visualizer

https://glitch.com/~a4-cenright71925 

This project allows data from the NYC 2010 census to be visualized in different ways. 
The user can control 6 things:
- The borough (which boroughs data the chart is showing)
- The type of chart: pie or bar
- The type of data: gender or race
- The main color of the chart
- The langauge the chart labels appear in 
- The types of values in the chart labels (counts or percentages)

The goal is to display this data in a way that is meaniningful and easily accsible for its users. Some issues I faced during this project was figuring out how to manipulate the data formats differnetly for a pie chart and for a bar chart. 

Linter: I used the Standard for my linting

### Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I wrote my own custom GLSL shaders to use as a material for my Three.js objects.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: My audiovisualizer uses both FFT and amplitude analysis to drive visualization.
- **Tech Achievement 3**: I optimized the efficiency of my reaction-diffusion algorithm by...
- **Tech Achievement 4**: I visualized the dataset X using three different visualization technqiues provided by D3, andprovided

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Color Shades**: I implemented a function that allows similar shades of a given color to be created. This allowed to pie chart to still utilize the user inputted color while having each section be distinct to the eye.
- **Language**: I implemented a language option. Because census data represents the population, I wanted the visualization to be accesible to that population. Besides English, Spanish is the most common primary language for people in NYC. By allowing the labels to be displayed in spanish, people can take screen shots of the charts generated by my app and use them in spanish langauge resourses.
